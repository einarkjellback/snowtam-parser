## Information on SNOWTAM
SNOWTAM stands for "snow warning to airmen" and provides aviation personel, such as pilots and airport staff, information about the condition of an airport's movement area as it is affected by precipitation or lack of thereof. Typical information that is included in a SNOWTAM is the type of percipitation that resides in the movement area, such as water, different types of snow, or simply dry if the movement area is dry; the amount of residual percipitation; and the friction coefficient.

For detailed information about the SNOWTAM format please consult [ICAO document 10066](https://ffac.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ICAO-Doc-10066-Aeronautical-Information-Management.pdf).
